# PROBLEM 

- Calculate the total price of all products where the keys *ARE NOT* blank, empty, undefined, NaN, etc. 

- keep in mind that key names in the object are likely to change. E.g., The item key can renamed to item_key or title. But your solution should still work. 

- Console log the total value of the products. Your total value should be 400.
